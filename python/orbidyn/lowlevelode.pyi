class LowLevelODE:
    """
    Container for an ODE problem with dynamic solution history accumulation.

    LowLevelODE is a high-level wrapper around OdeSolver that accumulates and manages
    the complete integration history. Unlike OdeSolver (which focuses on step-by-step
    iteration), LowLevelODE provides convenient methods to integrate over intervals
    and automatically stores all results.

    The object grows dynamically as integration methods are called. Each call to
    integrate(), integrate_until(), or rich_integrate() appends new results to the internal
    history.

    Parameters
    ----------
    f : callable
        Right-hand side of the ODE: f(t, q, *args) -> array.
        Must return an array of the same shape as q0.

    t0 : float
        Initial time.

    q0 : np.ndarray
        Initial state vector.

    jac : callable, optional
        Jacobian matrix function: jac(t, q, *args) -> matrix.
        Required for BDF method. Matrix elements should be jac[i, j] = df_i/dq_j.

    rtol, atol : float, optional
        Relative and absolute tolerance for adaptive step control.
        Error estimate: atol + rtol * |q|

    min_step : float, optional
        Minimum allowed step size. Default is 0 (no minimum).

    max_step : float, optional
        Maximum allowed step size. Default is None (no limit).

    stepsize : float, optional
        Initial step size estimate. If 0 (default), automatically determined.

    direction : {-1, 1}, optional
        Integration direction. 1 for forward (default), -1 for backward in time.

    args : tuple, optional
        Extra arguments passed to f, jac, and events. Default is ().

    events : iterable, optional
        Sequence of Event objects to detect. Default is ().

    method : str, optional
        Integration method. One of:
        - "RK23" (fastest, lowest accuracy)
        - "RK45" (recommended default)
        - "DOP853" (highest accuracy)
        - "BDF" (for stiff problems, requires jac)
        - "RK4" (fixed step size Runge-Kutta 4)
        Default is "RK45".

    scalar_type : str, optional
        Numerical precision. One of "double" (default), "float", "long double", "mpreal".

    Examples
    --------
    Basic integration:

    >>> def f(t, q):
    ...     return np.array([q[1], -q[0]])
    >>> ode = LowLevelODE(f, 0, np.array([1.0, 0.0]))
    >>> result = ode.integrate(10.0)
    >>> print(result.t)

    Integration with events:

    >>> event = PreciseEvent("crossing", lambda t, q: q[0] - 1)
    >>> ode = LowLevelODE(f, 0, np.array([1.0, 0.0]), events=[event])
    >>> result = ode.integrate(10.0)

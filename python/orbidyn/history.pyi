class OdeResult:
    """
    Encapsulation of a single ODE integration result segment.

    OdeResult represents the solution data from a single integration call (e.g.,
    ode.integrate(), ode.integrate_until(), or ode.rich_integrate()). Unlike LowLevelODE
    which accumulates all history, OdeResult contains only the newly computed segment.

    OdeResult instances are returned by integration methods and provide the same
    access patterns as LowLevelODE for convenience.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : OdeResult, optional
        Copy constructor. Create a new OdeResult from an existing one.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> ode = LowLevelODE(f, 0, q0)
    >>> result = ode.integrate(10.0)
    >>> print(result.t)       # Times in this segment
    >>> print(result.success) # Did it complete successfully?
    >>> print(result.message) # Why did it stop?

class OdeSolution(OdeResult):
    """
    ODE result with accurate continuous interpolation capability.

    OdeSolution extends OdeResult by providing callable interpolation to evaluate
    the solution at any time within the integration interval, not just at stored
    step times. The interpolation uses a method specialized to the integration
    algorithm (e.g., Hermite interpolation for RK methods).

    This is returned by rich_integrate() which retains all solver steps to ensure
    accurate interpolation. Use this for smooth visualization or evaluation at
    arbitrary times.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : OdeSolution, optional
        Copy constructor.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> ode = LowLevelODE(f, 0, q0)
    >>> sol = ode.rich_integrate(10.0)
    >>> # Evaluate at specific times
    >>> q_at_5 = sol(5.0)
    >>> q_at_3_14 = sol(3.14)
    >>> # Evaluate at many times at once
    >>> times = np.linspace(0, 10, 1000)

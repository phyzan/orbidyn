class VariationalSolver(OdeSolver):
    """
    Low-level ODE solver for variational equations with real-time Lyapunov exponent tracking.

    VariationalSolver is the step-by-step iterator for variational equations, similar to
    how OdeSolver iterates through standard ODE solutions. Unlike VariationalLowLevelODE
    (which accumulates full integration history), VariationalSolver maintains only the
    current state and provides real-time access to Lyapunov exponent calculations.

    This class integrates both the primary system and its variational equations
    (linearized perturbation dynamics) simultaneously. At regular intervals (determined
    by the period parameter), the variational state is renormalized to prevent numerical
    overflow, and Lyapunov exponent metrics are updated.

    The state vector has even length: the first half is the primary state, the second
    half is the variational state (perturbation vector). The variational state is
    automatically normalized to unit length at initialization and at each renormalization.

    Parameters
    ----------
    f : callable
        Right-hand side function for the original system: f(t, q, *args) -> array.
        The input q has length Nsys, and the output must match this length. The variational equations are automatically constructed from this function and the Jacobian, so they should not be included.

    jac : callable
        Jacobian matrix function for the original system: jac(t, q, *args) -> matrix.
        Required for BDF method. The Jacobian should have shape (Nsys, Nsys) for
        the original system.

    t0 : float
        Initial time.

    q0 : np.ndarray
        Initial state vector with even length. The first half is the primary state,
        the second half is the initial perturbation direction. The perturbation is
        automatically normalized to unit length at initialization.

    delta_q0 : np.ndarray
        Initial perturbation vector. The length should match the primary state (Nsys).
        The perturbation is automatically normalized to unit length at initialization.

    period : float
        Renormalization period for the variational state. The perturbation vector is
        renormalized to unit length every 'period' time units. The growth rate at each
        renormalization contributes to the Lyapunov exponent calculation.

    rtol, atol : float, optional
        Relative and absolute tolerance for adaptive step control.
        Error estimate: atol + rtol * |q|. Used only when the method is adaptive (e.g., RK45, BDF). Ignored for fixed-step RK4,
            except for estimating the initial step size if stepsize=0.

    min_step : float, optional
        Minimum allowed step size. Default is 0 (no minimum).

    max_step : float, optional
        Maximum allowed step size. Default is None (no limit).

    stepsize : float, optional
        Initial step size estimate. If 0 (default), automatically determined.

    direction : {-1, 1}, optional
        Integration direction. 1 for forward (default), -1 for backward.

    args : tuple, optional
        Extra arguments passed to f and jac. Default is ().

    events : iterable, optional
        Events to detect. Default is ().

        Event callbacks see the original system only, never the augmented one:
        when(t, q, *args) receives q with length Nsys (the primary state). The
        perturbation vector delta_q is not passed to event functions.

        Masked events are not supported here and raise RuntimeError, because
        applying a mask would interfere with the renormalization schedule of the
        variational state. Only event detection is available.

        Note that event_data() still reports the full augmented state (length
        2*Nsys) at each detected event, matching the layout of q.

    scalar_type : str, optional
        Numerical precision: "double" (default), "float", "long double", or "mpreal".

    method : str, optional
        Integration method: "RK23", "RK45" (default), "DOP853", "BDF" or "RK4"

    Attributes
    ----------
    t : float
        Current integration time (inherited from OdeSolver).

    q : np.ndarray
        Current state vector (primary state + variational state) (inherited from OdeSolver).

    logksi : float
        Cumulative logarithm of the variational state norm growth.
        This is the sum of log(|delta_q|) at each renormalization event.

    lyap : float
        Current estimate of the Lyapunov exponent: logksi / t_lyap.
        This is the average exponential growth rate of the perturbation.

    t_lyap : float
        Total time elapsed for Lyapunov exponent computation.
        This is the time since the first renormalization event.

    delta_s : float
        Most recent logarithmic growth "kick" from the last renormalization:
        delta_s = log(|delta_q|) before normalization.

    Notes
    -----
    This is a low-level iterator class. For most use cases, prefer using
    OdeSystem.get_variational() which returns VariationalLowLevelODE (a higher-level
    wrapper that accumulates history).

    The Lyapunov exponent is computed as:
    lambda = logksi / t_lyap = (1/T) * sum(log(|delta_q_i|))

    Positive Lyapunov exponents indicate chaos, negative indicate stability, and
    zero indicates neutral directions.

    Examples
    --------
    Create a variational solver for a simple oscillator:

    >>> from orbidyn import *
    >>> t, x, v = symbols('t, x, v')
    >>> system = OdeSystem(ode_sys=[v, -x], t=t, q=[x, v])
    >>> # Get compiled variational functions
    >>> f_ptr, jac_ptr = system._pointers(scalar_type='double', variational=True)[:2]
    >>> # Initial state: [x0, v0, dx, dv]
    >>> q0 = np.array([1.0, 0.0])
    >>> delta_q0 = np.array([1.0, 0.0])
    >>> solver = VariationalSolver(
    ...     f=f_ptr, jac=jac_ptr, t0=0, q0=q0, delta_q0=delta_q0, period=1.0,
    ...     method="RK45", scalar_type="double"
    ... )
    >>> # Step through integration
    >>> while solver.t < 10.0:
    ...     solver.advance()
    >>> print(f"Lyapunov exponent: {solver.lyap}")

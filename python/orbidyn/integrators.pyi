class LowLevelFunction:
    """
    Wrapper for compiled C/C++ ODE right-hand side function.

    LowLevelFunction encapsulates a pointer to a C/C++ compiled function that
    computes the ODE right-hand side. These are created internally by the OdeSystem
    class when compiling symbolic ODE definitions.

    Users typically do not instantiate this directly. Instead, extract instances via
    OdeSystem.lowlevel_odefunc property.

    The wrapped function signature is: f(t, q, *args) -> output_array
    where *args are scalar float values.

    Notes
    -----
    This class bridges the gap between symbolic/Python ODE definitions and the
    high-performance C++ compiled implementations. It enables the same ODE to be
    solved with different numerical precision types.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pointer : int
        Internal C/C++ function pointer (opaque, set by OdeSystem).

    input_size : int
        Length of the state vector q.

    output_shape : tuple of int
        Expected output array shape. Usually matches input_size or is compatible.

    Nargs : int
        Number of extra scalar arguments the function accepts.

    scalar_type : str, optional
        Numerical type ("double", "float", "long double", "mpreal"). Default is "double".

    Examples
    --------
    Do not directly instantiate. Instead use OdeSystem:

    >>> from orbidyn import *
    >>> t, x, y = symbols('t, x, y')
    >>> ode_sys = OdeSystem(ode_sys=[y, -x], t=t, q=[x, y])
    >>> compiled_f = ode_sys.lowlevel_odefunc()  # Returns LowLevelFunction
    >>> q = np.array([1.0, 0.0])
    >>> dq_dt = compiled_f(0.0, q)

class BDF(OdeSolver):
    """
    Implicit backward differentiation formula (BDF) method.

    A variable-order implicit method designed for stiff ODEs. Uses the Jacobian matrix
    to solve implicit equations at each step. Much more computationally expensive than
    explicit methods but handles stiff problems that would require prohibitively small
    step sizes with explicit methods.

        Must return a matrix of shape (len(q), len(q)) where jac[i, j] = df_i/dq_j.
        If None, central finite differences will be used to approximate the Jacobian,

def advance_all(solvers: Iterable[OdeSolver], t_goal: float, threads=-1, display_progress = False)->None:
    """
    Advance multiple OdeSolver objects to a target time in parallel.

    This function provides efficient batch advancement of low-level OdeSolver objects
    using multi-threaded parallelization. Unlike integrate_all which operates on
    LowLevelODE objects (which accumulate integration history), advance_all operates
    on the underlying OdeSolver objects which maintain only their current state.

    Each OdeSolver is advanced step-by-step from its current time to the target time
    t_goal, updating only its internal state (t, q, t_old, q_old) at each step without
    accumulating history. This is useful for advancing solvers obtained via the
    LowLevelODE.solver() method or when working directly with step-by-step integration.

    All solvers must use compiled functions (compiled=True). Solvers with different
    scalar types (double, float, long double, mpreal) are automatically grouped for
    efficient processing.

    Parameters
    ----------
    solvers : iterable of OdeSolver
        Collection of OdeSolver objects to advance. Each solver will be advanced from
        its current time to t_goal. All solvers must use compiled functions (not pure
        Python functions). Can include any OdeSolver subclass, as long as they inherit from
        the provided OdeSolver subclasses (e.g. RK45, BDF, etc.), and they have been constructed
        using fully compiled functions. If a custom OdeSolver subclass is passed that overrides
        the advance() method, that will NOT be called while integrating the solver to the requested
        t_goal. Instead, the compiled advance() method is used internally.

    t_goal : float
        Target time. Each solver advances from its current time (solver.t) to this
        target time using its adaptive stepping algorithm.

    threads : int, optional
        Number of worker threads for parallel execution.
        - 0 or -1 (default): Use number of CPU threads
        - n >= 1: Use n threads

    display_progress : bool, optional
        If True, print progress information during advancement. Default is False.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If any solver uses pure Python functions (compiled=False).
        If a list item is not a recognized OdeSolver object type.

    Notes
    -----
    All solvers are advanced synchronously. The function returns when all have
    reached t_goal.

    Unlike integrate_all (which works with LowLevelODE objects that accumulate
    integration history), advance_all works with the underlying OdeSolver objects
    that only maintain current state (t, q, t_old, q_old). The solvers are modified
    in place.

    Examples
    --------
    Advance multiple solvers to the same target time:

    >>> from orbidyn import *
    >>> t, x, v = symbols('t, x, v')
    >>> system = OdeSystem(ode_sys=[v, -x], t=t, q=[x, v])
    >>> # Create LowLevelODE objects
    >>> odes = [system.get(t0=0, q0=[1.0+0.01*i, 0.0], compiled=True) for i in range(10)]
    >>> # Extract underlying solvers
    >>> solvers = [ode.solver() for ode in odes]
    >>> # Advance all solvers to t=10.0
    >>> advance_all(solvers, t_goal=10.0, threads=4)
    >>> # Check final states
    >>> print(f"First solver at t={solvers[0].t:.3f}, q={solvers[0].q}")

    """

    Parameters    ----------
    solvers : iterable of OdeSolver
        Same as advance_all.
    events : str or Iterable[str]
        Name of a specific event to advance to, or an iterable of event names. If None (default), advances to the next event regardless of type. If iterable, each solver will be advanced until any of the specified events is located.
        Each solver must have the specified event(s) registered at initialization.
    tmax : float
        Maximum time to advance to if the event is not located. Each solver will be advanced from its current time (solver.t) to this target time using its adaptive stepping algorithm, if the event is not located before reaching tmax.
    threads : int, optional
